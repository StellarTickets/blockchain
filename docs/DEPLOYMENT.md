# Deployment checklist

1. `cargo test --workspace` — full suite green
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — no lint warnings
3. `stellar contract build` — optimized wasm builds cleanly
4. Deploy to **testnet** first; run through the full ticket lifecycle
   manually (create event, issue, verify, check in, list, buy resale)
   against a real testnet SEP-41 token
5. Only after a testnet soak period, deploy to **mainnet** with a
   production payment token and a hardware-backed admin key
6. Record the deployed contract ID in the backend's
   `TICKETING_CONTRACT_ID` environment variable
