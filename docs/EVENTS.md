# On-chain events

The contract publishes two Soroban events, defined with
`#[contractevent]` in `lib.rs`:

## `TicketIssued`

Emitted by `issue_ticket` and `purchase_primary`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ticket_id` | `u64` | topic |
| `event_id` | `u64` | |

## `TicketCheckedIn`

Emitted by `check_in`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ticket_id` | `u64` | topic |
| `organizer` | `Address` | |

Indexers and the backend's reconciliation job can subscribe to these
instead of polling `get_ticket` for every ticket on every block.
